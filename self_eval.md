# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
3. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
4. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

- Conditionals are useful when you have options are need different actions to take place in your code.
-  I would have written psuedo code to streamline the process of the final product. This would simplify my time used overall
-  The fact that the code runs. It is satisfying baking a cake and having it taste good simultaneously.
